==========
**Re**inforcement learning on **D**ynamic **K**nowledge **G**raphs (**ReDKG**) is a toolkit for deep reinforcement learning on dynamic knowledge graphs. it is designed to encode static and dynamic knowledge graphs (KG) by constructing vector representations for the entities and relationships. The reinforcement learning algorithm based on vector representations is designed to train recommendation models or models of decision support systems based on reinforcement learning (RL) using vector representations of graphs.

How to use
==========
 1. Clone repository
```
git clone ...
```
2. Install requirements
```python
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
3. Donwload test data
Download [ratings.csv](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/) to /data/ folder./
Data folder should be contains three files: 
 - ratings.csv - raw rating file of Movielens-20M dataset;
 -   kg.txt - knowledge graph file;
 -  item_index2enity_id.txt - the mapping from item indices in the raw rating file to entity IDs in the KG file;
4. Run preprocessing.py
```python
python preprocess.py
```
5. Run train.py
```python train.py
python preprocess.py
```

Project Structure
=================

The latest stable release of  is on the

The repository includes the following directories:
* Package `redkg` contains the main classes and scripts;
* Package `examples` includes several *how-to-use-cases* where you can start to discover how ReDKG works;
* Directory `data` shoul be contains data for modeling;
* All *unit and integration tests* can be observed in the `test` directory;
* The sources of the documentation are in the `docs`.


Cases and examples
==================
To learn representations with default values of arguments from command line, use:
```
python kg_run
```

To learn representations in ypur own project, use:

```python
from kge import KGEModel
from edge_predict import Evaluator
evaluator = Evaluator()
kge_model = KGEModel(model_name = MODEL_NAME, nentity=nentity, nrelation=nrelation, embedding_size=EMBEDDING_SIZE, gamma=GAMMA, evaluator=evaluator)
```

### Train KGQR model
To train KGQR model on your own data ...
```

```

Documentation
=============
Detailed information and description of ReDKG framework is available in the [`Documentation`](link)
